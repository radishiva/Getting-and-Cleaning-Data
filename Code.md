The run_analysis program loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
It also loads the activity and subject data for each dataset and
converts the activity and subject columns into factors.
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The tidy data is stored in tidy.txt.




For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

The following is the activity label:

WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test
